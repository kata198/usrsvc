NOTE: If you have "usrsvcd" located somewhere other than "/usr/bin/usrsvcd" in your install, you need to adjust the "usrsvcd@.service" lines that start with "Exec" accordingly.


Running "install.sh" will install the usrsvcd unit to the systemd directory, and reload the units.


Start usrsvcd for user, "myuser", by running:

systemctl start usrsvcd@myuser

Enable at boot by running:

systemctl enable usrsvcd@myuser


To install into a package, run like:

./install.sh DESTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT

or

./install.sh DESTDIR=$pkgdir
